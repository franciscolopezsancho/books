Abstract (second)
# Part I: five levels of skill. Beginner, advanced beginner, competence, proficiency and expert. 
## Part II
### The perceptual Noema. 
Husserl: how the object appears to conciousness. The idea.  
Follendal: the meaning
Gurwitsch: the percept (it's a thing
### Husserl conceptualization of perception: as interpretive sense
Meaning is an act of conciousness. [But we give meaning or is given to us?]
There is that paralelism with Husserl and Frege
In Frege the idea (our mental imagery), the sense (the concept), the reference (the thing)
Following that Husserl talks about : the act of giving meaning (-> idea). But here this might be the biggest contribution:      - this act, this intention, thinking from some perspective/category produces the meaning from the object

  The ideal meaning of Hus is the sense in Frege
  The filling act in Hus is a complement of the reference in Freg where the act is the realization that the idea/sense (Hus/Fre) is filled with the reference. [This reminds me to MPont that critiques how can the idea match the thing if it wasn't extracted prior? (not sure I'm quoting )]
  Signifying act => sense (as intermediary) => Fulfilling act. 
  PROBLEM: how does this work in perception? the sense of a perception. How does the meaning relates to the filling act? Let's put it in contrast with thinking. I can think of the moon, imagine it. Then reach the sense/meaning and finally compare if that can be applied to what I see when looking at the moon. But when dealing with the perception. How can I separate the meaning or the signifying act. Looking at this printed word, I perceive them as white over black, with some shape, letters and even some meaning. How then can I say if those senses fulfil their act. I'm tempted to say that I extracted, or found those senses out of looking at these letters and looking at them from different angles, so to say. color, shape and the meaning inside them. It seems the direction is the opposite. There's no fulfilling act, at the end of the process. It's the beginning. But we could ask, can we come back with those senses to the things themselves. I'd say yes.  [why?] 
  
  Unable to separate this two, fulfilling act and signifyng we experience in the perception, Husserl creates the trascendental phenomenology where only the sense, the signifying side is dealt with. Forgetting about the object, the fullfilling part he aims to create a pure theory that can be consistent, logical. That can be trusted for it doesn't corrode itself in the river of time.  
  It makes sense that the intentionallity then takes such a first plane in his theory. Losing the object as final test of truth leaves its vacuum in its place. The intention of the signifying act is therefore pure. 
 
### Gurtwisch incarnation of perception: The noema as intuitive sense. 
G confuses Husserl percecptual adumbration (seen an object always from a perspective, therefore incomplete) with the sense (in Husserl). This leads G to propose to noema as an the object seen from a perspective. From a side, from a category. Confusing the sense with the object itself and considering them different sides from the same coin. Noema in G is incarnated in the thing. 


### From trascendental to existencial phenomenology

Gur disolved the difference between Matter/form (like the Gestalt did), mind/body paving the way for the next thinker, Heidegger, to abandon the severed matter and form for a being in the world. And interaction, radically different.

## 3. Heidegger's critique of the husser/Searle view of intentionality
   H. critiques that there's no intentional content as such as there is no real/radical/original division of subject intending an object via a sense(Frege's sense). The relation/division subject/object is a creation a posteriori to the radical relation of both, which is of the object at a hand, expertise coping, flow. 
  Authors like Davidson and Searle might agree on the above but they add that in any case, activity, there's a mental side of it. For D. it's a goal, that correlates to the activity, for S. it's a self-reference, [some ego? or just a point or reference?]. Heid. defends the opposite. An activity in flow has not a mental goal, nor self-referenciality. Only a "broken" activity has it. Both assume Being-in-the-world. 


### Heid. account of primordial intentionality
    Heid negates the idea of a diff body/mind and so the intention like a mental pointer. Where Huss sees intentionality Heid. see the aboutness, minding your own businnes without a mental goal, or self-referenciality. These two can appear but are not the fundamental fabric of reality. 
      [I was thinking that Heid forgets the fact? that we can be inmersed in thinking and that is also an activity we can lose ourselves in. Meaning that the diff object/mind is not a second degree of experience by of first order. I very much doubt Heid. never thought about this so what's it's take? 
        -> you are absorved in world of significance
        -> extract from chatgpc Heid would say“You do not think about thoughts; you dwell in a mode of openness where things show up meaningfully.”. 
        -> read? "what is called thinking" Heid. ] 

### Being-in-the-world as original[me: radical] intentionality
    Every activity has a background, such when we stop the flow rest in it. [is there a beginning, initial activity that has no background]
    The background is the circunspection/care we take when dealing with the world, as a servant or a lord. 
    The background is not a theoretical or practical knowledge, it orient us before any of the two. It's a more basic kind of knowledge.

## Tode's account of the nonconceptual perceptual knowledge and it's relations with thought
  Todes defines perception as containing undeterminancy, as the need, the lack of something we are pull toward to. 
  Only when the need is fulfilled, we realise, now determined, what was pulling from us. 
    This is the same as the goal on the activities defined above. 
    To this unconcious pull, called MP *motor intentionality*. That is, embodied coping without conscious goal.
      Tode expands further this idea on a perception that informs, set our spacio temporal field. Back and front, past and future are built upon the embodiement. Not from a conscious, self-reflecting act. 
  Todes explains the existence, raise of concepts, when we skip one step on our perception process.
  1. prepare to percive (situate ourselves in the right spot) 2. prepare the object [maybe might be done with the same movement, like getting closer to an ant] getting the book under the light [again, or us out of the light] 3. perceive
  If 3. doesn't come to fruition then concepts arise.  

  Similar to the activity that discover its goal, or the need its original pull, the concepts that arise with the imagination when 3. seemed to have been there all along. 
  Tode holds that imagination and perception are not irreducible one to the other, 

# Overcoming the myth of mental
## the indubitability of a mental Given
Descartes or McDowell bet for it but phenomenology bets for an embodied knowledge
## is it perception or action always conceptual
Drey would argue that like bike wheels we might use them to learn but we ditch them later. Worth noting infants learn by imitation.
Here McDowell repeats what Heid would insist on: we found always engaged with the world. We are always open to the worl. That's our radical openness. [I could extend that Huss when using the intentionalitly probably (maybe only posibly) had this in sight. 

--------------------------

# Part I: Phenomenology and skills:

In this chapter the author argues that there are 5 levels of coping. When a skill is used such, chess for example.
Novice. Learns the rules and only behave by applying them. It lacks the ability to see the task as a whole and progress to him means following, each rule. His performance is meassured (by him) by how well he follows the rules.  
Advance Beginner. With experience starts to see meaningful parts of the overall situation. Learns some patterns. The performance is uncoordinate and laborious. 
Competence. 
  The number of features he can see multiplies, so much so that he needs and builds a hierarchical view. Now not just follows rules, starts by choosing a plan. A strategy. 
  Since he chooses the goal, and the approach there is emotional attachment to the final result. 
  The different aspects are remembered in relation to the overall plan.
Proficiency:
  The plan, goal, strikes him more than he elaborates it. He understand the goal intuitively and it's all about developing the best plan. 
Expert:
  Not only is striken by what it needs to be done, but to how to do it. Both come without effort, or thought processing. 
  Example of this are walking are talking. We don't put attention to it. Just do them  



# Part II: Intentionality and mind

## 2. The perceptual Noema
   47 - Is the intentional correlate of perceptual conciousness
   [[[ the noema is the intentional correlate of the noesis, is how the object appears to conciousness ]]]
   In husserl intentionality is the defining feature of consciusness, and intentionality is defined by the necessary correlation between noesis and noema.  
   The perceptual noema is the meaning, the ideal entity correlated with the act of perception. 
     here you have two ways of understanding this concept in Husserl
       as a concept: Follendal
          More in line with Husserls interpretation
       as a percept: Gurwitsch
          is not perceived but is given in perception and selected with a special act directed to the perceptual object 
          It's used by many other authors and used as a criticism to Husserl by Merlau Ponty 
            It points more to a fundamental gap in Husserls theory, more than it's critique.
            
            [I guess like gestalt is considered as a thing out there we can reach with that special act]
            
###  Husserl conceptualization of perception, as interpretive sense.         
     Husser calls meaning to the content of the act of conciousness that give meaning to the sounds (those that are expression)
     There's a parallele between Frege and Husserl
       H -> act of giving meaning - ideal meaning - sense act of fulfillment of the meaning
       F -> idea - reference - sense
     The meaning in H is the base of his theory of knowledge and experience 
     Q: He argues that we have ordinary in front of us the reference of our experience but we can by reflexion reach the sense. 
       The sense is how a thing is specifically think. Robert as my friend, Robert as my father. 
       the sense is always present but we can make it the explicit object of our attention by reflection. 
     One of the fundamental problems in Husserl is making sure that each signifying act has a correspondent filling act. 
     - [[When thinking, or wishing that seems easy. When thinking I can reflect that I'm thinking in something. And here's the key, the signifying act of the thinking it has an intermediary, the sense, that links it with the thought. Whether what is thought exists or not.  
     signifying act -> sense -> filling act.
     ]]
     - [[key here: 
        signifying act => thinking about something but not actually experiencing it. Thinking about tomorrow.
        fulfilling act => the experience of tomorrow that I thought today. Where the two meet!
        How then sense relates to both. In the signifying act there a sense, the thought that is "universal" that can be thought by anyone. This correlation. 
        ]]
     The problem for Husserl is how to par this to the perception? What's the perceptual sense that links the perception act with the perceptual filling act? [I struggle to use those any of these three categories here: ]  
     

     ]]
     In the Fifth investigation Husser takes on all acts and their ideal content and in the sixth the relation between signifying acts and fullfilling acts AND the fulfilling acts and their objects.   
     According to Husserl (or Dreyfuss): since all perceptual act is a fulfilling act, that fulfillment must relate to a signification.  
     56
     Dreyfuss reviews:  Acts were divided between signifying acts and fulfilling acts. then The perceptual act (fulfilling per excelence) was again divided in the two above. This like zenons paradox divides the fulfilling act in two, a signifying part and a fulfilling one. Therefore there's a infinite recursion.  
     To get out of this recursion, Husserl (says Dreyfuss?) comes up with an incarnate meaning. Which can have both sides a signifying one and a fulfilling.  
     57
     Husserl can't find a way to reconciliate the Fregean concept of sense, atemporal and inmatirial to this 'incarnate meaning' [see above] 

     Unable to resolve this conondrum Husserl makes virtue from its necessity and create the trascendental phenomenology. A theory that only deals with the ideal contents, the sense, whether there's an object that fulfills that sense or not. 

  # Gurwitsch and the incarnation of perception: The noema as intuitive sense.
    Gurwitsh like the Gestalt agree that what we perceive is an incarnate form. As Gurwitsch puts it "it's a system of functional significances...all interdependent...there's no unifying principle in addition to the matters unified"   :
    The sense, by G, of what's experience is a different sense on Huss. 
    This intuitive sense that could fulfill and complete the interpretive sense would complete Huss theory. If not contradictory of course. [[these two can be names as the raw perception and the structured/idealized perception]]  
    63 
    There's an ambiguity in G about what the noema is:
    - *What* is intended 
    -  The object *as* is intended or how is intended
      This comes from the confusion that H calls What is intended the `perceived as such` 
     64 
     What is intended = the object
     The sense = the meant as such 
     66 
     G confuses the noema (the sense) with the percetual adumbration. The latter being that objects are always given through an angle, perspective, side. Never complete. 
     G putting together sense an perception makes a jump from H. Such perception becomes referencially transparent, the contrary as H would defend. Perception in referencially opaque, the sense (meaning) doesn't know of the existence of it's object. Only of its intention. 


  # From transcendental to existencial phonomenology.
    Gestalt argues that sense it's inseparable from its filling [Q: what do they mean? if I can obviously refer to something that's not present]. Here G encounters a contradiction [says Drey] since the phenologist (here G) argues that objects are represented via the sense as they are given. But since adumbration entails, we only perceive a side of the object. Therefore if the sense doesn't also cover those sides of the object won't be faithful to the filling. Therefore the sense just won't be true.  
    H however doesn't face ever such a problem. For him sense and object it intends dwell in different dimensions.
    Gur. changes the Hus. perspective from how the objects are taken by the tracendental ego and reduction to how the objects are given. Losing the ideal side of the subject.  
    Drey. argues the Gur. point on the given is not true for a song. Where Gur. defends that the song, as organized perceptual object is given as long with the notes [Just like Gestalt would argue] but Drey. contraarguments that the song can be taken as a melody.

    74
    We can view the interpretive sense as a bodily set. The set comes out from skill or habit and is a set. In particular, in perception the interpretive sense as a bodily set can be correlated with the experience of the "thickness" of the object.
    This others side are not mere appearence but an inclination I can "feel" [and therefore perceive] to investigate the object from different angles. 
    I'm not a monad with all the world in me, nor obsolutely open to the stream of being-in-the-world. [I'm a situated subject around a copresent objects that draw my acts to diversion] Drey says they are copresent to me and I am copresent to them. [copresent here means I am among them (the latter) and they are part of me] 
    Drey states that our skill with objects are aspatial and atemporal [I reckon he refers to the skill as a property/genere, and not to any skill in particular.] But they are not ideal, as Huss noema. They are not abstractable, they can't be considered apart from their "activation". 
    [Interesting enough] Then Drey goes into say that these skills can't be considered as abstractable objects themselves, apart from their objects of engagement. These perceptual skills unify our experience but can't be an object of our experience themselves. [Q: Then how come we can talk about them?] 

    75
    Nor Hus or Gur could have a consistent theory of the trascendental reduction. Hus for deattaching the sense from the filling, form and matter. Ended leaving out the objects he wanted to explain. But even Gur, in its attenuated version couldn't reach the objects themselves. The embodied objects. As he stayed in his "universal medium of whatever exists" that conciousness and the system of appearances had in common. The relation between this system and the objects again was severed.  

    76
    Like the Gestalt, Gur, negating the dychotomy between matter/form and up being destroying the diff between body/mind. Hence the next only found exit. Heigegger and being-in-the-world. 
    To Gur goes the honer of preparing the phenomenolgy to move from trascendental to phenomenologic. And Merlau-Ponty to take the step. 





## Heid critique of the Husserl/Searle account of intentionality
   The first argument against cartesian rationality (held also by Huss) tradition of Hei is to present it as a deattached version of everyday involment [if everyday involment means flow]
   But the real critique, to Huss, comes from two opposit accounts of intentionality:
   - intentional content action vs intentional content of thought. 
   He states that being-in-the-world doesn't involve intentional content at all. Intentional content in the context of a subject with that intentional content and an object [I understand intentional content as sense]. Those components can't be isolated. 
   Saele/Davison both have a model where action is explained through subject with mental states. Heid, again, tries to break away from this dicotomy. 
   For Huss, phenomenology is the intentional content left in the mind [Q: trascendent here?] after the bracketing of the world.  
   Heid, tries to introduce an intentionality that has no trace of mental content. 
   Huss, never worked with the idea of action but Searle/Davidson did. Dreyf will oppose Heidg actions to the Searl/Davidson accounts.  
   There's a camp that agrees that perception and action are causal. The perception is caused by the object perceived and the action by the mental in the right way [right way meaning intention of doing so, not a reflex act, hipnosis, or another action not intented] 
   Davison states that an action to be the rigth way needs intention
    Searle doesn't, since there can be spontaneus actions. Although for it requires:
    1. a goal correlate to the action
      2. and a causal conection between this goal and the action
    ?[] S. defends a self-referential causality between the the goal, whether is prior to the action or born from an spontaneus action. Such an action is a bodily movement bring about by the intention of performing the action [does action here have different meanings?]
    Heid. seeks to show:
     1. 
       a. intentionality without self-referenctial content is a natural act. [ready at hand?]
       b. with self-referential is an impeded act [present at hand]
     2. a and b presuppose being-in-the-world. This BITW is the transcendent condition of a and b, also called active and comtemplative intentionality. 

     ### Heid account of primordial intentionality
     Heid. opposese to those two view that Huss could have but that Searle exposes. 
     1. Acting and acted upon are phenomenologically distinguible
     2. [not 100% sure this is point 2] Follows from point 1 that the experience of acting and the bodily experience are distinct. They belong to two different domains. 
     Heid opposes that
     1. the experience of acting must be the experience of *me* causing the action
     2. the experience of acting must represent the conditions of the satisfaction of the action.
     
     Searle points out that action implies self-awereness. Heidg. denies that [me too, think flow]. MerlPont would put it like our body gets suggestiongs from the situation to get the optimal relation, regarding the performing action. [true that when learning we keep thinking and trying to get the right feeling. For example, learning tennis. When learned already we skip the thinking but the feeling stays, and we cope with it] 

     Drey points out that one doesn't distinguish our experience of acting of the acting itself. [I would say that happens at jerks, or intervals. That at one point you get embedded in the action and lose the conscious of yourself and at other you see yourself doing the action. Like in third person] 

     Searle applies to perception the same analysis that applies to action; Seeing a flower, he starts, has two components the experience of seeing the flower and the flower [can't see how this can be possible. The analysis, how can he reach the flower knowledge without the experience first] 

     on 82[Seeing is like a dialog where the thing keeps offering different potentials sides and I keep inspect them]

     MP would argue, against Searle, that the experience it's our experience of our openness to the world. Does that 

     Drey argues against MP that we don't experience ourselves as passive receivers [he's talking about the example of MP about an infant looking at a world without presuposing inner egos behind other beings] [I would agree with Drey that perceiving, generally thought first seeing could be better grasp like touching. When we touch we investigate, move around surfaces, press. That's not passive, and it's unfrequent, and not the norm I'd say, that we feel contact as a passive experience]


     some discussion about first and third person perspective. 
     Then some about rejection of Heid, Searles self-referentiality. Since Searle argues one can always answer what it was doing when asked.  
     On the other hand, Heid states we can make sense about what were we doing not by reference to a mental state but by "towards-which/woraufhin" (non intentionalistic) chunck.
       These chunks are all those things that compose a goal, like all the things one might do before going to work until it gets there. Having a shower, dress, go to the parking, pick the car etc.  

    Again we are back to the expert example, with a chessmaster that moves towards/along with a strategy without a specific plan. Chunk, by chunk, solving each situation with a tactic. 

    Here Drey uses, and states so, the word activity instead of action when explaining the above. Idea/distinction that was ntroduced by Heid. as Verhalten (behavior/conduct)
    Also Heid. substitutes the primordial intentionality in Husserl for aboutness. Minding your own businness, with the caviat that is not an acitivity of the mind, but the embodyment of what one is about. 
    The behavior with take on about what we are dealing with, reveals certain aspects of the situation at hand. That's directing ourselves towards-which or being directed
    This intentionality, this behavior denotes not only act of conciusness but any kind of activity [we could think this, like being animal racional, that as any other animal goes about his business but with a layer of top of mental discourse, maybe also the distinction between me and other, although that sounds like Heid. present at hand.]
    For Hus/Searl/Foosdel the intentionality is about how I'm taking some experience. Taking something as something, [my interpretation? maybe interpretation falls short]. And to this there's always an ego. 
    On the other hand, Heid defends that:
    1. Skillfull coping is a mode of awareness
    2. My behavior is form bit by bit through experience
    3. When we are not skillful we default to intentionality subject/object 

   ## Being-in-the-world as original intentionallity 
   Heid argues that whether the activity is absorved or directed[Drey says deliberate] there's a background the orients it, that makes it possible.  
   It's the absorved activity A that provides that unnoticed background for the activity B, deliberate or not. 
   Searle and Heid share the idea of background but they are quite different:
   - In Searle the background are the non intentional capabilities and practices that make intentionality possible. Adding that they hold a self-referencial content.
   - In Heid. There's no self-referencial content and they are considered intentional. This activities [note they are not capabilities/practices] are a continual and provide a ontological trascendence. [I would call this an informed perspective]. This background is the circunspection of what we have in front in order to serve or mandate us what to do, how, and when.  
     - Being-in-the-world is the constant adjusting to the circumstance. The accommodation to each activity. [I'd say that the background is born from our familiarity with certain circumstance, from a child to which lacks any familiarity (and also self-referencial). 

     **[and here's the kicker] The Heid background is what we call being. But the understanding of being is not a theoretical or practical knowledge. In both activities there is alreayd and understanding of being. And for Drey this is the contribution of Heid to the western philosophy.** 

   ## Tode's account of nonconceptual perceptual knowledge and it's relation with thought
   [This continues with the above Hied state, about the background that so far only delimitated negatively]
   Tode's differenciates two kinds of knowledge:
   - perceptual 
   - imaginative -> this derives from the perceptual
   both objective 

   Davidson opposes that perceptual knowledge, that is, judgment to be so must be conceptual all the way out. 
   Tode's account of nonconceptual knowledge feeds on MerlP idea that perceiving is about getting grip, better one if possible, of what we perceive. [ Like if I look this sofa at one's inch distance I get pull back to see it as a whole. If I want to put it in a room for example. On the other hand, before buying it I might feel drawn to watch it one inch distance and touch it to make sure the quality is what I'm looking for]
   The fact/idea of the skill feedback loop over perception and back it's called by MerlP intentional arc. [why arc and not circle? / For example when I learn a new word, a new move in a sport, I see it everywhere and in seeing it I might see something similar that now I can add to my language or sport] 

   To explain how perception hides its indeterminancy Tode's uses the idea of need. A positive negation that moves us toward a better grip. Different to a logical negation that points to the absence of something. The need is a positive force in this sense [Say the thirst of perception]   
   In moving to fulfil the need the determination of the perceived is not fully form, only when the need is fulfilled we realize that that was what the need was pointing at. [Again is not a logical if then but the gravity that pull us, in the dark room a vague shadow only when we touch it we realize is a coushing] Then you realize that you were looking at a coushing all along. Informing your previous perceptions. There's a retrofitting. Recalling your vague impressions now they might be blurry but the object it's recognized as a coushing.  
   This retrofitting, argues Todes, is the same with skillful coping. We don't have a clear picture of the goal of the activity, it's at the end when looking back that we infuse the actions with the goal. Same as with perception. 

   MerlP call to this embodiment of the action without conscious goal but directed, motor intentionality. 
   Todes also agrees with MerlP about the distinction of the expected condition of satifaction and ongoing satisfaction when coping.  
   Todes extends this motor intentionality with the idea of a perceptual knowledge that it's added in the ongoing coping 
   How the conceptual is born from the non-conceptual it's bases in that both the coping and "trying" (p95) live in a spaciotemporal field produced? by the body. 
   Todes in this respect goes beyond MerlP in that not only the body give us what we can do in relation to this field but that it also informes it. Our body produces this experience of space and time.  
   What we have in front ties with the future, the back with the past. The present is what is ready at hand. 
   Todes concludes that our movement builds our spatiotemporal field.  
   And this back and front is also how we experience what we perceive. They have back and front, inside and outside that our perception adjust and moves around to perceive them fully. Or if not fully are least towards a more complete, comprehensive view. 
   Todes argues that we make also perceptual inferences such looking at a box made of solid wood, when trying to lift it we dispose our body to exert certain strengh. If the box is very light will be suprised and our standings won't have the grip we expected. 
   McDowell proposes a test to prove that a perceptual inference contains a concept. That is, being reindentifaible. To which Todes will try to prove that that's the case. That the body performs reidentification when coping, treating the activity at hand and it's object as a unity. [In this unity I suspect lies the capacity for identification] 
   Here dreyfuss introduces the concept of body-set as the identification mechanism. Such that the activities I perform over the object, my body movements, the options it generates on my dealing with it are identifiable. [Maybe there's a box inside a box, like russian dolls, that give context inside the context, body-set inside body-set that make it identifiable.]   

   In this line MPont points out that makes no sense to explain perception as imputating significance to certain signs since that significance only have meaning as long as point to those signs. [Seems like a circular reasoning] 
   On the other hand, if perception is nonconceptual all way in how can we make concepts, from where they come from. 
   Todes explain this in two stages with are only part of the total threefold perceptual experience. 
   - we prepare ourselves to perceive the object
   - we prepare the object to be perceived 
   - we perceive
   Taking out this third step we come up with a descontextualized perception that give raise to concepts. Instead of reaching to the things themselves we only approch them by their properties. [I did put `their` in there. Not sure that's going to far since talking about properties as part of the object we may incur in a circular argument] 
   It's the imagination that allows us to move from the embodied of actual things to the possible ones, property structured.
   **And same as when we finisht and activite via skillful coping we find the goal was there all along, or satisfy our need for a better grip of a situation we found the need all along, with the imagination happens the same. When we think on those objects as if it was practical perception, we experience them as existing all along.**[not sure this follows]  
   McDowell argues that perception is from the get go conceptual or not at all
    while Todes counters that perception is only conceptual when deattached from the context of skillful activities. **Furthermore, imagination and perception are irreducible to the other. Same as activities we anticipate and some activities we produce.** 

   Todes constructs, like Kant through thought, a model of ininteligebility of the world through perception. p102 [I would have expected skilful coping or activity] 
   But there's a flow ...

   ## 5 Overcoming the Myth of mental.  
   ### How philosophers can profit from the Phenomenology of everyday expertise.
   Lewis was on the 50ties was arguing in favor of the need of an indubitable Given to ground knowledge. McDowell follows this idea and ground knowledge in perception. On the other hand, Sellars have been working on a fundamental structure, aka, embodied coping as the fundation on knowledge.   
   #### 1. The failure of cognitivism
   To think that we can extract the properties and then find the truth but manipulating the sign following some logic. 
   #### 2. The phenomenological alternative
   How can we manage, in the vast array of knowledge we have, what is relevant for each context? 
   It seems that our everyday coping can't be reduced to simbolism [or so that goes Dreyfuss, here I wonder, knowledge about fact is obvious know that AI can do that. The interesting question now is how could they cope with everyday activities. We should describe some activity like playing tenis and we can see very well that a machine could very well do that. So now we might be looking for a difference in grade? more than qualities. Meaning, are there activities that are so funtamentally different to think or play a sport that we can say that those a machine, current AI wouldn't be able to do?
   Further more, or maybe oppossite to the above, is AI working with simbols? Or not really since it doesn't really give them meaning, as intension. Maybe is on the other side, just extension is enough. What things go together and how do they affect to each other. Learn, those relation, those wheels that changing here would modify that there and you'll know what you are doing. But here comes now the ideas above about the goal of an activity. Where does the goal fit in all this. Computer, AFAIC, don't put goals themselves at the moment. Do we?] 
   #### 3. Are perception and action conceptual?
   McDowell. We found ourselves always engaged with the world. **That's what he calls openness**  
   Although McD postulates that this engagement has always a conceptual component. This is via a "second nature". *Pronesis* or practical wisdom, idea that takes from Aristotle 
   Drey admits that learning can, migth even always, involve a conceptual component. But after the learning is done, then as already stated at the beginning of the book, expert coping doesn't necessarily invoke or use concepts. Drey states that Phronesis is actually a counter argument for McD theory.  
   Heid. share this approach or understaning of expertis coping with Drey. 
   It seems that myth of given, dead for McD gives rise with its corpes to the myth of Mental. [Platon would agree I would say]
   #### 4. What is expertise?
   while infants learn with imitation, trial and error we, adults, start with rules. [Shouldn't we change that]
   Rules are like trainig wheels, repeats Drey.
   #### 5. The space of motivations
   In betwenn as world of causes (mechanicist, physics), or reasons, such as goals and thought, MerlP proposes a third way. [ The motivations which is a bodily attunement via learned skilful coping that provides open responsiveness. ]
   Again Dreyfuss conveys this image of grip when coping with a situation. Better of worse. In any case we move towards the better, to a more satisfactory conditions when the grip is not such that we don't bother no more. It's just right. Then we move into another dimension of the activity. 
   Animal, infants pre lingual, and experts live in this grip dimension, focus in the activity at hand without further deliberation. 
   #### 6. Non conceptual coping and the justification of judgement
   Even in expert coping doesn't include concepts as Gibson defends, McDowell point still stands. That is, that if perception justifies our judgmente/concepts then it must be conceptual all the way down. 
     Lewis might have been wrong in defending the existence of the Given, as a raw experience, is ineffable and indubitable. 
      McDowell argues that this way then the Given can't justify any conceptual belief.   
      Drey and the fenomenologist contra argue that perception doesn't justify knowledge, what it does is to give meaning to our activities. It's not the role of the perception to justify knowldge [on the contrary, it seems to be the lack of expert coping, maybe the pure form of perception, is what makes room for knowledge as idealist defend. As a theory.] 
   #### 7. Where concepts come in 
   question1, [McDowell? page121]. How can perception do its justificatory job if nonceptual given is converted in give with conceptual content
   question2. Todes, how conceptual arises from non conceptual content 
    Todes start answering by stating that the world as open to us in perception is related to our bodies. There is back and front, up and down. Those are structures not that we impose or overimpose to the world but how reality is, radically. In this sense, the embodied perception is normative or the reality itself, of the experience.  
    Then it divides this embodied perception in 12 categories just as Kant did in its 'critic'. 

   Drey insists that concepts are not implicit in our embodied perception just as goals are either in our activities when expertfully coping. 
































































Heideggers critique of the Sarle/Hussers account of intentionality:
- It's often said that Hiedegger proposes more practical approach to "reality" than cartesian Husserl. An subsumes knowledge as a deattached form of activity.  
  - The real difference is a different account of intentionalitity. 
    - intentional content of action vs intentional content of thought.
      - Husserl refers to intentional content as the remaining content after the braqueting of the world.	  
      - Heidegger in it's definition of intentionalit avoids the mental content altogether. 
        - Heidgg states that the split mind/world is not necessary, not a primary disctintion.
        - the relation between acting/knowing and the world. Dreyfuss will focus in action and the world.  
          - two postions on the relation action and the world. Heidegger and Sarle. 
            - "it's is generally agreed that the comonsense concepts of perception and action are causal concepts"
            -  
Heidegger account of primordial intentionality
 - Searle/Husserl observations. I can think of moving and not move like when paralized and I can move (like a puppet/with electrodes) without **acting**.
